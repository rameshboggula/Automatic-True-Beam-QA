Automatic-True-Beam-QA
======================
A repository dedicated to submit XML and Matlab code that allows Automatic QA procedures on True Beam. 

The XML scripts are written according to the True Beam Developer Mode manual that could be found at:

http://virtualinac.com/devmode/content/TrueBeam_Developer_Mode_Manual_V_0.2.0_March_2012.pdf. 

Imaging QA tests according to TG 179, TG-142 and the "AAPM Medical Physics Practice Guideline 2.a:
Commissioning and quality assurance of X-rayâ€“based image-guided radiotherapy systems" are implemented. 

Each imaging test has been included in an XML file. The reader could take maximum advantage of the XML scripts if they are combined into one script and uploaded at once to the True Beam Developer Console. Such procedure is described somewhere else.

For such procedure to be effective all imaging phantoms should be localized on the couch at the same time. 

These methodology would be further simplified if a universal phantom that allows all imaging tests to be acquired is built.
